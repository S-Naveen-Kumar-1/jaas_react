    </div>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">Examining many approaches while solving math problems is an effective strategy that stimulates students' critical and creative thinking. In BeGalileo, we emphasize the importance of this method by providing opportunities for students to engage in brainstorming sessions with the teachers to solve various math solutions on a whiteboard or a digital screen. By helping the students to explore different methods of problem-solving, we aim to sharpen their mathematical acumen, critical thinking and visualization power. </p>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">Students are constantly encouraged to think outside the box and consider multiple approaches to solving a problem. This process not only cultivates a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts but also promotes a flexible and adaptive mindset that is essential for tackling complex problems. Students are able to visually compare and contrast alternative tactics and get insight into the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy by showing many solutions for the same problem.</p>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">The Socratic style of teaching, in which the teacher acts more as a facilitator by leading students through a sequence of questions that urge them to think carefully about a topic, is the foundation of the whole educational approach in examining numerous answers. Rather than providing direct answers, the teacher prompts students to analyze, question, and evaluate their own ideas. This process challenges students to articulate their thoughts clearly, defend their positions, and consider alternative viewpoints.</p>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">The shift from a focus on "how" to a deeper understanding of "why" is what beGalileo emphasizes on. Instead of simply memorizing procedures students are encouraged to explore the underlying principles and logic behind every mathematical concept. This gives mathematics a deeper meaning while also enabling pupils to use what they've learned in a range of situations and scenarios.</p>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">Consider the lesson on Quadratic Equations as an example. Rather than simply defining a quadratic equation, the goal is to gradually introduce the concept, starting with a basic linear equation in one variable. The teacher guides students to understand that the solutions of an equation represent the values that satisfy it, which are also known as the zeros of the function when expressed in that form. These solutions are also referred to as the roots of the function. When the equation or function is graphed, these solutions correspond to the points where the graph intersects the x-axis. Throughout the lesson, our educators guide students to realize the interconnectedness of these concepts, encouraging them to arrive at the answers through a Socratic approach, rather than simply providing the solutions outright.</p>
    <div class="content-blocks">
    <img class="title_images"  width="600" height="400" src="https://d325uq16osfh2r.cloudfront.net/blog-page-content-images/top-5-solutions-to-leverage-emerging-technology/multiple_solutions.png" alt="multiple-solution">
    </div>
     <p class="para_plus_wrapper">The act of exploring multiple solutions is not only beneficial for solving individual problems but also for developing a broader mathematical mindset. It pushes pupils to be inventive and open-minded, looking for many approaches and viewpoints to solve problems. This mindset is invaluable in mathematics, where problems are often multifaceted and require creative thinking to solve effectively.</p>
